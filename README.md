# sane-airscan -- SANE backend for AirScan (eSCL) and WSD document scanners

Similar to how most modern network printers support "driverless" printing,
using the universal vendor-neutral printing protocol, many modern network
scanners and MFPs support "driverless" scanning.

Driverless scanning comes in two flavors:
* Apple **AirScan** or **AirPrint scanning** (official protocol name is eSCL)
* Microsoft **WSD**, or **WS-Scan** (term WSD means "Web Services for Devices)

This backend implements both protocols, choosing automatically between them.
It was successfully tested with many devices from **Brother**, **Canon**,
**Dell**, **Kyocera**, **Lexmark**, **Epson**, **HP**, **OKI**, **Panasonic**,
**Pantum**, **Ricoh**, **Samsung** and **Xerox** both in WSD and eSCL modes.

For eSCL devices, Apple maintains [a comprehensive list](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201311)
of compatible devices, but please note, this list contains not only scanners and MFP,
but pure printers as well.

This backend doesn't require to install and doesn't conflict with
vendor-provided proprietary software like ScanGear from Canon, HPLIP from HP
and so on.

### Features

1. One backend for two different protocols, eSCL and WSD
2. Automatic and manual device discovery and configuration
3. Scan from platen and ADF, in duplex and simplex modes, multi-page
scan from ADF supported as well
4. Scan in color and gray scale modes
5. Line-by-line image unpacking, for low memory footprint
6. The cancel operation is as fast as possible, depending on your hardware
7. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported

### Compatibility

Any **eSCL** and **WSD** capable scanner expected to work. Here is a list of devices
that were actually tested. If you have success with a scanner not included
into this list, please let me know.

In most cases, devices were tested with network connection. However, most (all?) of
the **eSCL** devices will also work over **USB**, if **IPP-over-USB** daemon is installed on
your computer. WSD-only devices cannot be used with the IPP-over-USB daemon.

The **IPP-over-USB** comes with the `ipp-usb` package and often installed by default.
If your distro comes without `ipp-usb`, please visit the project page to figure out
alternative ways to obtain it: [ipp-usb](https://github.com/OpenPrinting/ipp-usb)

Legend:

* **Yes** - device works perfectly
* **No** - protocol not supported by device
* **?** - device works with `sane-airscan`, but protocol is not reported by user
* Space - author has no information on this mode/device combination

be scaled down by the factor 2/3 at this case. Lower resolutions works well.

### Distros that come with sane-airscan

The following distros (in alphabetical order) include `sane-airscan`
officially:
* ALT Linux (Sisyphus and p9)
* Arch Linux (in extra repository)
* Debian 10+
* Fedora 32+
* NixOS
* Ubuntu 20.10+

This list is constantly growing and may be very incomplete.

Also, `sane-airscan` works on BSD and included into FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD ports.

### Installation from pre-build binaries

If you use one of the following Linux distros:
* **Debian** (9.0 and 10)
* **Fedora** (29, 30, 31 and 32)
* **openSUSE** (Leap and Tumbleweed)
* **Ubuntu** (16.04, 18.04, 19.04, 19.10 and 20.04)

[Follow this link](https://software.opensuse.org//download.html?project=home%3Apzz&package=sane-airscan),
where you will find packages and very detailed installation instructions.

Note, after a fresh build this link sometimes takes too long to update, so if you encounter
"Resource is no longer available!" problems, there is
a direct link to repositories: [https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/pzz/](https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/pzz/)

I strongly recommend you to choose "Add repository and install manually"
option rather that "Grab binary packages directly", because it will
enable automatic updates of the sane-airscan package.

**Linux Mint** users may use Ubuntu packages:
* Linux Mint 18.x - use packages for Ubuntu 16.04
* Linux Mint 19.x - use packages for Ubuntu 18.04
* Linux Mint 20.x - use packages for Ubuntu 20.04

### Contribution

All contributions are welcome and greatly appreciated, assuming the following:

1. Feature that you propose has a general interest for many people
2. Your code is well-formatted and has a good quality

Please note, this project has two branches:

* stable branch: https://github.com/alexpevzner/sane-airscan
* development branch: https://github.com/alexpevzner/sane-airscan-unstable

Stable branch accepts mostly bug fixes and minor features with small
change in code base. Major features should be contributed into the
development branch.

### Paid consulting

If your business depends on my project, and you require any specific feature not
currently implemented here, you may consider contracting me on a paid basis.

### PVS-Studio

[PVS-Studio](https://www.viva64.com/en/pvs-studio/) is a static code analyser,
supporting C, C++, C# and Java.

Once upon a time I was chatting with its authors in Russian software development
forum and told them, that if their tool will find something interesting in my
code, I will put a reference to their project here.

Their tool actually found a couple real bugs, so I had to fulfill my promise :-)

Now I regularly test this code with PVS-Studio, and it really helps. Their
product is not free, but they offer free licenses for open source projects.

### Reporting bugs

To report a bug, please [create a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/alexpevzner/sane-airscan/issues/new)

To create a helpful bug report, please perform the following steps:

1. Enable protocol trace in the sane-airscan, by adding the following
entries into the configuration file <br> (**/etc/sane.d/airscan.conf**):
```
[debug]
trace = ~/airscan/trace ; Path to directory where trace files will be saved
```
You may use an arbitrary directory path, assuming you have enough rights
to create and write this directory. The directory will be created automatically.

2. Reproduce the problem. Please, don't use any confidential documents
when problem is being reproduces, as their content will be visible to
others.

3. Explain the problem carefully

4. In the directory you've specified as the trace parameter, you will find
two files. Assuming you are using program xsane and your device name is
"Kyocera MFP Scanner", file names will be **"xsane-Kyocera-MFP-Scanner.log"**
and **"xsane-Kyocera-MFP-Scanner.tar"**. Please, attach both of these files
to the new issue.

## References

The eSCL protocol is not documented, but this is simple protocol,
based on HTTP and XML, easy for reverse engineering. There are many
Internet resources around, related to this protocol, and among others
I want to note the following links:

* [kno10/python-scan-eSCL](https://github.com/kno10/python-scan-eSCL) - a tiny
Python script, able to scan from eSCL-compatible scanners
* [SimulPiscator/AirSane](https://github.com/SimulPiscator/AirSane) - this
project solves the reverse problem, converting any SANE-compatible scanner
into eSCL server. Author claims that it is compatible with Mopria and
Apple clients
* [markosjal/AirScan-eSCL.txt](https://gist.github.com/markosjal/79d03cc4f1fd287016906e7ff6f07136) - document,
describing eSCL protocol, based on reverse engineering. Not complete and
not always accurate, but gives the good introduction
